ldesc: "MPlayer can play most standard video formats out of the box and
almost all others with the help of external codecs. MPlayer currently
works best from the command line, but visual feedback for many functions
is available from its onscreen status display (OSD), which is also used
for displaying subtitles. MPlayer also has a GUI with skin support and
several unofficial alternative graphical frontends are available."
